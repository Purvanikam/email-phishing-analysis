- iPhone 14, INR 7 Lakh cash, merchandise — unrealistic reward package.
-  "Too good to be true" content is common in scams.

-  Emotional pressure is a key phishing strategy.

### 4. Sender Identity Hidden

- If it’s not from `@internshala.com`, it could be **spoofed**.

### 5. Link Unverified
- Link behind “CLAIM YOUR iPHONE” is **not shown**.
-  Hover needed to verify if it points to a valid `internshala.com` page.
